        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Junior at BYU studying Computer Science, this is my 3rd year. 
			I enjoy the pain of finding bugs in my code, as well as helping others debug their code.
			I hope to do some full-stack development as a job and go down the Software Engineer route in the near future.
			My Start-up project was based on a different program I found that works and I have chosen to re-create my own version of it.
        </p>
        <p>
			A little background about me, I am from Merritt Island, Florida.
			I grew up on the coast and love to go to the beach. It is my favorite thing to do when I go home. I graduated from Edgewood Jr/Sr High School with my Diploma of Distinction.
			I started working for The Home Depot before college and then transferred to the Provo, Utah store when I began school.
			I enjoy spending time with family and traveling around the world. I love to go on crusies and flying across the globe to other countries.
        </p>

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          For my Start-up Project, I am re-creating a new version of LDS Tools used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This version will be more interactive and will aid leaders of Young Single Adult wards that use the app.
			The link can be found <a href ="https://ysa.organizationtools.org"> here.</a> More featurs will be added periodically as the 2023 year progresses.
